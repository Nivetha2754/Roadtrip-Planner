# Roadtrip-Planner
As travelling restrictions are beginning to be lifted globally, maybe it’s finally time for you to plan that roadtrip! In this project, you’ll give users the opportunity to list out the destinations they want to visit, let users order them, and display the best route between destinations.
As a user, I should be able to add destinations. I should be able to do this by using a form, click on a map (with an API call), or other approaches included.
As a user, I should be able to rearrange the order of my destinations.
As a user, I’d like to be able to see my destinations on a map.
As a user, I’d like to be able to see information about the distance and journey time between each destination.
As a user, I’d like to be able to see summary data about my entire journey. This could include the total time, distance and, for extra points, even the fuel needed.
As a user, I’d like my data to be stored in my browser’s local storage so I can navigate away from this page and come back with the data still there.
